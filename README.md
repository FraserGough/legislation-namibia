# legislation-namibia
## What the project does
This project is for creating a Microsoft Word template to help legislative drafters in Namibia create Bills that are formatted correctly.
## Why the project is useful
Bills are highly structured documents that have to comply with certain formatting standards. The template will help drafters comply with those standards by:
* allowing proper formatting to be applied using simple keystrokes
* automatically generating an in-document table of contents for a Bill
* providing a system for maintaining cross-references within a Bill
## Who maintains and contributes to the project
* The project is maintained and contributed to by Fraser Gough, a legislative drafter in the Scottish Government's Parliamentary Counsel Office. It is an unpaid, voluntary effort.
* If anyone would like to join the project, please contact gough.fraser@gmail.com.
